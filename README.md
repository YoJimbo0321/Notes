# Notes

This is just a repository that I use to upload Markdown notes and send them to other people, because GitHub conveniently creates a table of contents.

Ideally, this repo would be unlisted, BUT GitHub doesn't support that, so...

And I *could* use unlisted GitHub Gists instead, but those don't have tables of contents, sooo...

So, enjoy this peek into my thrilling private life, I guess.
