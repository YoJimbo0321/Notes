## Mouse Weight, Size, and Shape Considerations

- **When it comes to mouse weight, generally speaking, lighter is better. With all other factors being equal, a lighter mouse will always be easier to control than an identical but heavier mouse (up until some arbitrary weight where the difference is no longer significant enough to be felt). This is because the heavier mouse will have more inertia, and have greater momentum when in motion. It is objectively more difficult to get a heavier mouse to start or stop moving than an identical but lighter mouse.**
- A hypothetical weightless mouse would, in theory, provide the most direct translation of your hand movements to mouse movements, with zero added inertia from the mass of the mouse interfering. The lighter a mouse gets, the closer it gets to this ideal. However, it can be argued that the mass of a mouse can be helpful for compensating for deficiencies in fine motor control (jittery hands, etc.). Some may prefer the stability of mice above a certain weight that "absorb" some of their twitchiness and imperfect movements.
- **Narrower mice are generally more precise than wider mice, because the hand is able to get a tighter and more precise grip on the mouse, though this strongly depends on the exact characteristics of the mouse shape. Generally speaking, the narrower the better, as long as the mouse size and shape are still comfortable for your hand size and grip style.**
- Mice that taper inwards on the side walls can help "lock in" the hand when moving and lifting the mouse, as the fingers can find purchase underneath the "overhang", but that same tapering may interfere with the ability to get a stable grip on the sides.
- Higher mouse button heights can be more comfortable, but lower button heights are more precise, since your fingertips don't have to be raised as much. Different mouse "hump" widths/heights/shapes can also complement different grip styles and selectively prioritize comfort, stability, and/or precision. 
- An ergonomic mouse that fills out the hand with a rounded mid-section and high buttons can be comfortable for everyday use, but may not be the most precise choice for games.
- A mouse that has a relatively wide hump towards the back and drops down low towards the buttons can "fill out" the base of your palm for support and stability while not getting in the way of your fingers, giving you better control.
- A mouse that is relatively low-profile throughout can synergize with fingertip grips that want to minimize contact with the mouse for maximum dexterity, though at the cost of comfort and stability. Low-profile mice also inherently tend to be smaller and lighter, which further synergizes with fingertip grip priorities.
- While often overlooked, the position of the sensor on the underside of the mouse can actually have a fairly significant impact on the feeling of mouse movement in-game. Consider the arcing movements one makes with their arm when sweeping/flicking the mouse to either side. Now imagine the sensor tracing those movements and leaving behind an arcing trail. If the sensor placement is noticeably towards the front or towards the back of the mouse, that could noticeably affect the size of the arc, and thus the amount of mouse movement in-game. This effect becomes more pronounced the more you are twisting/turning the mouse as you move it, and is especially noticeable when twisting your wrist for flicks or micro-adjustments.

## Mousepad, and Mouse Feet/Skates Considerations

- When it comes to mousepad and mouse skate set ups, there are two main factors to consider: the static friction and the dynamic friction.
- Higher static friction generally correlates to higher stopping power, but also makes it more difficult to make micro-adjustments from a standstill.
- Lower static friction conversely correlates to greater ease of making micro-adjustments at the cost of stopping power.
- Higher dynamic friction generally correlates to better control over the mouse when it is in motion (which can also correlate to stopping power), but can also feel "muddy" if too high, making it harder to push the mouse where you want it to go.
- Lower dynamic friction conversely correlates to a faster glide, but can also feel "slippery" if too low, as the mouse will have greater momentum in motion (especially with heavier mice).
- Roughly speaking, lower static friction and higher dynamic friction (up to a point) should make it easier to control higher sensitivities.
- In addition to the surface, stopping power can also be affected by different thicknesses and densities/hardness/softness of the mousepad (ex. a "Mid" hardness pad can feel very different compared to its "X-Soft" equivalent).

## General Mouse Sensitivity and CPI Considerations

- One's personal best mouse sensitivity will depend on their setup (size/shape/weight of mouse, friction of mouse skates/mousepad, etc.) and on their personal anatomy/biomechanics (hand size, arm length, wrist flexibility, etc.).
- One's ideal/preferred sensitivity could also vary depending on the game (common aiming ranges/situations, character/enemy movement speed, etc.). Particularly important considerations include: whether the game has ADS or not, the speed of character movement, the relative importance of smooth tracking aim vs quick flicks, whether or not the game penalizes accuracy while moving (which in turn affects whether you can use strafing to help make adjustments while shooting), etc.
- You could even choose to change your sensitivity depending on what role/character you're playing within a single given game. For example, playing on a higher sensitivity for melee or dive characters in Overwatch vs mid-to-far range DPS characters.
- Technically, a mouse set to a higher CPI should be somewhat more precise due to literally having an increased number of counts per inch versus a lower CPI, and lower effective latency as a result (shorter gaps between ticks). As such, a mouse set at 1600 CPI and 1.0 sensitivity in a given game should, in theory, have the same cm/360 distance as a mouse set at 400 CPI and 4.0 sensitivity, while being slightly more precise and having lower effective latency. However, pro and other notable players often seem to anecdotally prefer their mouse to be at 400 or 800 CPI, rather than say 1600 or 3200 CPI.
- The reasoning behind this could have something to do with the pixel/count ratio of certain CPIs at certain sensitivities. While the cm/360 should the same, a higher resolution CPI at a lower sensitivity will have a lower pixel/count ratio than the equivalent lower CPI at a higher sensitivity, again since it literally has an increased number of counts per inch (each count of the mouse moves a lesser/"finer" number of pixels). The lower resolution CPI will conversely have a higher pixel/count ratio (each count of the mouse moves a greater/"coarser" number of pixels). 
- A difference in pixel/count ratio shouldn't cause much of a difference in feel in practice (unless there is pixel skipping due to the pixel/count ratio being greater than 1, typically only caused by a combination of very low CPI and high sens), but it could potentially subtly affect how it feels to move your mouse around in-game. For example, it is possible that the "coarser" higher pixel/count ratio of a lower CPI with higher sensitivity feels slightly less "jitter-y" or something.

## CPI Deviation

- Most mice will have at least some small amount of deviation from the CPI that they're set to, simply due to variance and imperfections in sensors.
- However, in some cases, due to poor QC or just poorly design, CPI deviation and skipping isues can be made more severe due to the implementation of the sensor (such as how recessed/high the sensor is or how well it reads a particular mousepad surface), the thickness of the mouse skates, etc.
- **As such, it is best to think of the sensitivity ranges listed below as APPROXIMATES based mainly on the type of aiming movements you would be making. Specific sensitivities should be thought of as a baseline rather than a perfectly accurate value that will translate flawlessly across different mice, because they probably won't. This is especially true if you switch between different mice. The same sensitivity may not produce the same in-game cm/360 distance on different mice, so you may have to adjust the sensitivity slightly up or down between mice to retain the same feel.**
- Also note that this effect becomes more pronounced at lower CPIs with higher pixel/count ratios, as each individual skipped/missed count will constitute a greater error.

## General Mouse Sensitivity Ranges (Anecdotal and Subjective)

```
- High: ~10-30 cm/360 (mainly wrist aiming, arm sweeps for larger movements outside of the comfortable wrist flick range)
- Mid:  ~30-50 cm/360 (a combination of wrist aiming and arm aiming depending on situation and playstyle)
- Low:  ~50-70 cm/360 (mainly arm sweeps with only tiny micro-adjustments done with the wrist)
```

### High Sensitivities

- Sensitivities in the High range allow you to cover a wider area with quick and precise wrist flicks, minimizing the usage of less precise arm sweeps, and have an objectively faster turn rate for snapping between multiple angles/targets or quickly turning around.
- In a vacuum, higher sensitivities are faster and more flexible than low sensitivities, making them better suited to dealing with less-than-ideal situations, such as flicking to a target at the edge of your screen, having to make a quick turn to face an enemy behind you, or tracking a strafing enemy at very close range.
- **In theory, with perfect, robotic mouse control, a high sensitivity is the most optimal overall, in that there is objectively less movement of the mouse required to move the crosshair to any given position. HOWEVER, the main disadvantages, practically speaking, is that controlling the mouse is more difficult, and that lapses in mouse control can be more impactful, potentially leading to inconsistency and instability. Steady tracking in particular can be difficult depending on the game/situation.**
- Jittery hands or imprecision due to caffeine, sleep deprivation, or other disruptions are amplified the higher your mouse sensitivity is, and, conversely, reduced the lower your mouse sensitivity is. Mental/physical tension that prevents you from smoothly operating your mouse is also a factor (i.e. if you tense up and become unable to make the very fine movements you need.)
- In some games, like Apex Legends, enemies can begin shooting at you from many different angles, and once a fight begins, you have to be able to properly track a moving opponent as they run, jump, and slide all over the place. Because such situations are core to the game, it may warrant the use of a higher sensitivity. Additionally, as there is little accuracy penalty for shooting while strafing, strafing can be used to help line up your shots while moving, both of which can help compensate for the potential difficulty of tracking targets with just the mouse at higher sensitivities. Those same factors also make it more viable (and necessary at higher levels) to misdirect and dodge enemy fire through movement while also firing back, again potentially warranting a higher sensitivity to keep up with.
- Sensitivities that are <20 cm/360 generally seem too fast to be extremely consistent with, and can be almost physically impossible to be precise with when making tiny corrections and micro-adjustments. At lower mouse CPIs like 400, extremely high sensitivities can also introduce pixel skipping, which is obviously not desirable.

### Low Sensitivities

- Sensitivities in the Low range give you the most leniency, stability, and consistency. You are less likely to wildly throw off your aim with imperfect movements of your mouse, and any variances coming from differences in your ergonomics, physical condition, and so on are minimized.
- This comes at the cost of speed and agility, especially when responding to less-than-ideal situations far from the center of your screen, or in close-range engagements. You are also limited in the range that you can cover with precise wrist flicks.
- Aiming in all FPS games benefit from proper positioning, pre-aiming, and crosshair placement, but these concepts are especially important in certain games, such as Valorant or other "tactical" FPS, with one-shot-kill headshot potential, (generally) limited mobility, and maps designed for holding and peeking angles. The more you can avoid non-ideal situations, the less you may "need" the benefits of a higher sensitivity, which can make the stability of lower sensitivities more appealing. Furthermore, because of the relatively slow movement speed and the significant accuracy penalty while moving in games like Valorant, it becomes more important to quickly and precisely line up your shots with just your mouse movement, which could also warrant a lower sensitivity. These same factors also make it more viable to make small and compact adjustments to your movement and aim through counter-strafing and other techniques, again potentially warranting a lower sensitivity to stay in control of.
- Sensitivities that are >60 cm/360 generally seem TOO slow, even for tactical shooters. Past a certain point, the benefits in terms of stability are marginal, and even with proper positioning, pre-aiming, and crosshair placement, you are increasingly limiting your ability to deal with non-ideal situations. You also begin seriously sacrificing the ability to use your wrist to make small adjustments or precise flicks as the range comfortably covered by the wrist shrinks to a negligible size. Tracking moving targets can also become difficult, as you have to "fight the sensitivity" to keep up with your target, as well as increasingly needing to lift the mouse to reset on the mousepad.

### Mid Sensitivities

- Sensitivities in the Mid range mix the advantages and disadvantages of High and Low sensitivities. Compared to Low sensitivities, Mid sensitivities are faster and more agile, but sacrifice some of the leniency and stability. Compared to High sensitivities, Mid sensitivities are more lenient and stable, but sacrifice speed and agility. Mouse movements will typically be made mainly with the wrist (like High sensitivities) when close to the center of the screen, and made with compound movements consisting of arm sweeps with adjustments made by the wrist (like Low Sensitivities) when further from the center of the screen.
- **Generally speaking, Mid sensitivities are a best-of-both-worlds option. However, they can ALSO have unique disadvantages/trade-offs, due to being neither a mainly wrist-focused nor a mainly arm-focused sensitivity range. Compared to a sensitivity in the High or Low range, a Mid sensitivity can have more awkward in-between zones that are outside of your comfortable wrist flick range, and/or too close to comfortably arm sweep to. The exact cm/360 values that could feel awkward for you may vary based on your individual anatomy/biomechanics, but these awkward zones would require more careful and compact movements to reach, making them more inefficient and difficult to cover. You can of course practice to cover those zones more effectively, but those kinds of motions will always be more mechanically complex and prone to error than a wrist flick or a more lenient arm sweep.**
- **That being said, it is debatable how relevant this would actually be in most practical in-game situations. For example, in a game like Valorant, being too slow/imprecise when reaching for such a zone in a 1-shot kill situation could be disastrous, but proper pre-aiming and positioning would probably make such occurrences rare outside of a few specific angles or situations. Meanwhile, in a game like Apex Legends, enemies popping up in those awkward zones is much more common, but being slightly too slow on your initial flick to such a zone is rarely going to outright decide the fight, due to the higher TTK and movement options available.**

## TL;DR

- Don't think about it too hard, it's too confusing if you're dumb like me.
- Just go into Aim Lab, plug in your base sensitivity and FOV, and follow the instructions above to find out what ADS sensitivity multiplier values you need to plug in to get 0% monitor match scaling.
- Note that for games like Valorant that do not have individual sensitivity sliders for each and every zoom level/optic, you will have to choose one optic to "sync up" with.

## Assorted Quotes/Explanations

> If you were to use the exact same sensitivity in these two examples, the lower FOV option would feel exceedingly fast and hard to control, despite the cm/360 being identical. This is because the pixels per degree are vastly different. Despite moving 1 degree in both examples, the pixels traveled is immensely different.
> 
> This is precisely why scopes have sensitivity multipliers to make them slower. If you use the same cm/360 when zooming in, things suddenly feel too fast. This also goes both ways, 30cm/360 on 90 HFOV may feel like a mid to low range sensitivity. But 30cm/360 will likely feel significantly faster when playing on 120 HFOV.

> For example, using 50% horizontal monitor match will make the mouse movement needed to flick to the middle between your crosshair and the edge of your screen EXACTLY THE SAME, regardless if you are scoping or not.
> 
> So, why 0% monitor match is considered the best ?
> 
> The answer is quite simple : the farther you are from the monitor match distance point, the greater the innacuracy will be. As you usually need to do very small flickshots when scoping, 0% is the way to go in most situations. Furthermore, THIS 0% IS THE SAME FOR EVERY SCREEN RATIO (4:3, 16:9, 16:10, 21:9 ...).
> 
> You can still use another monitor match if it doesn't fit you, I know many players who prefer to use 100% horizontal monitor match distance.

> The reason why you can judge distances properly with 0% is because the distance scales with the zoom. If you zoom in 2x, the target will be 2x further away on your screen, and will require 2x more mouse movement to flick to compared to before the zoom. If you make this a fair comparison and scale the distance between you and the target to counteract the zoom, then the mouse distances will be the same. This will also benefit tracking, since the perceived movement speed, size, and distance of the movement will scale with the zoom, and so will the sensitivity. So if the distance between you and the target scales with the zoom also, then a target will move the same speed across your screen, and require the exact same mouse movement.

> Match distance isn't "accurate within a circle." Any match distance will only be perfectly matched at that specific distance and just get more and more off the further you are from it, whether it's more inside or outside. However distance match only works when you're starting at 0° horizontal. I.e. if you're aiming up or down at all, even a little bit, then the concept of a distance being matched stops working entirely.
> 
> The big reason to use "0% distance" is that it's actually scaling by zoom ratio aka focal length. This is desirable most obviously because you're, well... scaling by the zoom. 2x zoom means 1/2 sensitivity. A secondary reason this is desirable is that this mimics how your brain automatically scales aiming based on distance from target. E.g. if a target moves from 100 meters to 50 meters then you have to move your mouse 2x the distance to stay on target. The target will also appear 2x as large since it's half the distance away (kind of like 2x zoom).

> "0% isnt a distance, so it wont 'distance match' to some point on the screen. The matching points won't be a ring either, but a single point at each pole.
> 
> 0% scales the sensitivity by the things that actually change, such as zoom and curvature, so it preserves your sensitivity and it's just the curvature of the image that makes it behave differently.
> 
> Pretend you are at the center of a sphere. You can think of 2D as 0 fov, an infinitely zoomed in, infinitely flat portion of a sphere is on your screen. As you raise the fov, you zoom out, revealing more of the sphere. The physical size of the sphere reduces as you zoom out, and the curvature within the physical space that is your monitor increases. This change in zoom and curvature is what 0% is scaling the sensitivity by.
> 
> You traverse a pretty flat image at low fovs, and a highly curved image at high fovs. Then you also have the size of the sphere changing, so low fovs require long distances and high fov require short distances to rotate 360 degrees. No matter what, it will always be a different experience at different fovs. 0% will properly scale the sensitivity itself, but you still have these factors changing the experience. This is where you try other match % to try and make it feel more comfortable, but I wouldn't decide what % to use based on some distance rule as the distance thing has pretty much no benefits."

## Left/Right Lean Keybinds

- (From some YouTube comment) "For a more basic config, leaning is often on Q and E. Try swapping Q and E around. You'll get used to leaning right with Q and left with E quite quickly (within a few hours max). The advantage is that you can peek around a corner moving right (D) while leaning right (Q), then when you need to get back in cover moving left you let go of lean automatically. This is 100% better than not swapping and works well enough for slower paced games. For faster paced games there are likely more efficient (more exotic) configs possible."
