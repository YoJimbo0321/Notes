## Mouse Weight, Size, and Shape Considerations

- **When it comes to mouse weight, generally speaking, lighter is better. With all other factors being equal, a lighter mouse will always be easier to control than an identical but heavier mouse (up until some arbitrary weight where the difference is no longer significant enough to be felt). This is because the heavier mouse will have more inertia, and have greater momentum when in motion. It is objectively more difficult to get a heavier mouse to start or stop moving than an identical but lighter mouse.**
- A hypothetical weightless mouse would, in theory, provide the most direct translation of your hand movements to mouse movements, with zero added inertia from the mass of the mouse interfering. The lighter a mouse gets, the closer it gets to this ideal. However, it can be argued that the mass of a mouse can be helpful for compensating for deficiencies in fine motor control (jittery hands, etc.). As such, some may prefer the stability of mice above a certain weight that can "absorb" some of their twitchiness and imperfect movements, though this is also something that can be accounted for in mousepad choice.
- Narrower mice are typically more precise than wider mice, because the hand is able to get a tighter and more precise grip on the mouse, though this strongly depends on the exact characteristics of the mouse shape. Generally speaking, the narrower the better, as long as the mouse size and shape are still comfortable for your hand size and grip style.
- Mice with lower main click button height are typically more precise than mice with higher buttons, since your fingertips rest closer to the surface of the mousepad.
- "Ergo" mouse shapes fill out the hand with contours designed to encourage an ergonomic tilted grip, and typically feature a rounded mid-section and high button height. Ergo mice can be comfortable for everyday use, but may not be the most precise choice for games due to the tilted grip and high button height.
- "Ambi" or symmetrical mouse shapes are generally safer and more "universal", but potentially less comfortable, especially for extended use. Some mice are mostly symmetrical but have some subtle ergonomic curvature to try and get the best of both worlds.
- Different middle or back "hump" widths/heights/shapes can also complement different grip styles and selectively prioritize comfort, stability, precision and/or freedom of movement for micro-adjustments within the hand.
- Mice that are relatively low-profile throughout without a prominent hump can synergize with fingertip grips that want to minimize contact with the mouse for maximum dexterity, though at the cost of comfort and stability. Low-profile mice also inherently tend to be smaller and lighter, which further synergizes with fingertip grip priorities.
- Mice that taper inwards on the sides from back to front (front of mouse narrower than the back) and/or mice with prominent humps towards the back can assist with the stability of your mouse grip, as the fingers can get a precise grip on the narrower sides while the wider back "fills out" the base of the palm. However, this comes at a trade-off of limiting the ability to make micro-adjustments within the hand using finger movements.
- Mice that taper inwards on the sides from top to bottom (inwardly slanted side walls) can assist with keeping a solid grip on the mouse when lifting and moving it around, as the fingers can find purchase under the "overhang" as they grip the narrower portion. However, an overly aggressively slant may interfere with the ability to get a stable grip on the sides.
- While often overlooked, the position of the sensor on the underside of the mouse can actually have a fairly significant impact on the feeling of mouse movement in-game. Consider the arcing movements one naturally makes with their arm when sweeping/flicking the mouse to either side, then imagine the sensor tracing those movements and leaving behind a visible arcing trail. Compared to a relatively central sensor position, placing the sensor more towards the front or towards the back of the mouse could noticeably affect the length and curvature of the arc, in turn affecting mouse movement in-game. This effect also becomes more pronounced the more you twist/turn the mouse as you move it, and is especially noticeable when twisting your wrist for flicks or micro-adjustments.

## Mousepad and Mouse Feet/Skates Considerations

- **Mousepads and mouse skates can have a surprisingly significant effect on the overall feel of your setup, as the way that they interact with each other can significantly impact the friction and glide of the mouse.**
- When it comes to mousepad size, bigger is typically better (at least ~400x400mm). Larger mousepads give you more freedom to experiment with mouse sensitivity and reduce the need to reset your hand position between movements.
- Apart from size, there are two main factors to consider when it comes to mousepads (and mouse skates): the "static" or "initial" friction, and the "kinetic" or "dynamic" friction.
- Higher static friction generally correlates with a more "locked in" feeling after stopping the mouse and may contribute to stopping power, but also makes it more difficult to make micro-adjustments from a standstill.
- Lower static friction conversely generally correlates with greater ease of making micro-adjustments, potentially at the cost of stopping power.
- Higher kinetic friction generally correlates with better overall control over the mouse when it is in motion and better stopping power, but can also feel "muddy" if too high, making it harder to push the mouse where you want it to go.
- Lower kinetic friction conversely generally correlates with an overall faster glide, but can also feel "slippery" if too low, as the mouse will have greater momentum in motion (especially with heavier mice).
- **In addition to the mouse skates and mousepad surface, stopping power and glide speed can also be affected by different mousepad thicknesses and densities/hardness/softness. For example, compared to a given mousepad in "Mid" hardness, the "X-Soft" equivalent may have a less consistent glide speed but superior stopping power depending on how much you force you apply to "dig into" the mousepad.**
- **While the level of kinetic friction in your setup is largely due to personal preference and how much you value stability/control versus freedom/speed, it is generally advisable to keep the level of static friction low, preferably as low as possible without reaching the point where your ability to "lock in" the mouse is compromised. This is because high static friction compromises your ability to make small adjustments to your aim. Furthermore, even for setups where the static friction isn't that high in a vacuum, if the static friction is RELATIVELY high compared to the kinetic friction, it can cause you to overshoot targets closer to your crosshair due to the steep "dip" in friction experienced as you transition from static to kinetic friction with each mouse movement.**

## General Mouse Sensitivity and CPI Considerations

- **One's ideal/preferred mouse sensitivity will depend on their setup (size/shape/weight of mouse, friction of mouse skates/mousepad, etc.) and on their personal anatomy/biomechanics (hand size, arm length, wrist flexibility, etc.).**
- **The preferred sensitivity could also vary depending on the specific game. Some particularly important game-specific considerations include: TTK, the relative importance of smooth tracking vs quick flicks, what the common aiming ranges are, how much vertical aiming you need to do, character movement speed and movement options, whether or not the game penalizes accuracy while moving (which in turn affects whether you can use strafing to help make adjustments while shooting), whether the game has ADS zoom or not (ADS zoom and optics can make higher sensitivities more manageable at longer ranges), etc.**
- **Additionally, aiming in all FPS games benefits from proper positioning, pre-aiming, and crosshair placement, and each can serve to enhance the strengths of a given mouse sensitivity while mitigating any drawbacks.**
- You could even choose to change your sensitivity depending on what role/character you're playing within a single given game. For example, playing on a higher sensitivity for close-range characters and a lower sensitivity for mid-to-far range characters in games like Overwatch.
- Technically, a mouse set to a higher CPI should be somewhat more precise due to literally having an increased number of counts per inch versus a lower CPI, and lower effective latency as a result (shorter gaps between ticks). As such, a mouse set at 1600 CPI and 1.0 sensitivity in a given game should, in theory, have the same cm/360 distance as a mouse set at 400 CPI and 4.0 sensitivity, while being slightly more precise and having lower effective latency. However, pro and other notable players often seem to anecdotally prefer their mouse to be at 400 or 800 CPI, rather than say 1600 or 3200 CPI.
- The reasoning behind this could have something to do with the pixel/count ratio of certain CPIs at certain sensitivities. While the cm/360 should the same, a higher resolution CPI at a lower sensitivity will have a lower pixel/count ratio than the equivalent lower CPI at a higher sensitivity, again since it literally has an increased number of counts per inch (each count of the mouse moves a lesser/"finer" number of pixels). The lower resolution CPI will conversely have a higher pixel/count ratio (each count of the mouse moves a greater/"coarser" number of pixels). 
- A difference in pixel/count ratio shouldn't cause much of a difference in feel in practice (unless there is pixel skipping due to the pixel/count ratio being greater than 1, typically only caused by a combination of very low CPI and high sens), but it could potentially subtly affect how it feels to move your mouse around in-game. For example, it is possible that the "coarser" higher pixel/count ratio of a lower CPI with higher sensitivity feels slightly less "jitter-y" or something.

## CPI Deviation

- Most mice will have at least some small amount of deviation from the CPI that they're set to, simply due to variance and imperfections in sensors.
- However, in some cases, due to poor QC or just poorly design, CPI deviation and skipping isues can be made more severe due to the implementation of the sensor (such as how recessed/high the sensor is or how well it reads a particular mousepad surface), the thickness of the mouse skates, etc.
- **As such, it is best to think of the sensitivity ranges listed below as APPROXIMATES based mainly on the type of aiming movements you would be making. Specific sensitivities should be thought of as a baseline rather than a perfectly accurate value that will translate flawlessly across different mice, because they probably won't. This is especially true if you switch between different mice. The same sensitivity may not produce the same in-game cm/360 distance on different mice, so you may have to adjust the sensitivity slightly up or down between mice to retain the same feel.**
- Also note that this effect becomes more pronounced at lower CPIs with higher pixel/count ratios, as each individual skipped/missed count will constitute a greater error.

## Mouse Sensitivity Ranges

- **The following is an anecdotal and subjective estimation of the three main/effective sensitivity ranges. There's no hard rule for what exact sensitivities match with what exact mouse movements, and there is obviously a lot of cross-over, especially for sensitivies close to a border between ranges.** 

```
- High: ~10-30 cm/360 (mainly wrist aiming, arm sweeps used for larger movements outside of the comfortable wrist flick range)
- Mid:  ~30-50 cm/360 (a combination of wrist aiming and arm aiming depending on situation and exact sensitivity)
- Low:  ~50-80 cm/360 (mainly arm aiming with small micro-adjustments)
```

### High Sensitivities

- Sensitivities in the High range allow you to mainly use compact wrist flick movements, which are quicker and more precise than sweeping arm movements, for the majority of your aiming within a central zone. Arm movements are instead reserved mainly for wide turns, which become much faster at higher sensitivities.
- In THEORY, with perfect, robotic mouse control, a high sensitivity should be the most optimal overall, because there is objectively less mouse movement required to move the crosshair to any given position. In a vacuum, High sensitivities are also better suited to dealing with certain less-than-ideal situations, such as flicking to a target at the edge of your screen, having to make a quick turn to face an enemy somewhere to your side or behind you, or tracking enemies at very close range (~0-5 m).
- HOWEVER, the main disadvantages of a high sensitivity, practically speaking, are that precisely controlling the mouse is generally more difficult overall, and that lapses in mouse control can be more impactful, potentially leading to increased inconsistency and instability. Jittery hands or imprecision due to caffeine, sleep deprivation, or other disruptions are amplified the higher your mouse sensitivity is and, conversely, reduced the lower your mouse sensitivity is. Mental/physical tension that prevents you from smoothly operating your mouse is also a factor (i.e. if you tense up in a stressful situation and become unable to make the very fine movements you need in that moment.)
- A high sensitivity can also make steady tracking at mid-to-far range, making small micro-adjustments, and aiming at targets just outside of your comfortable wrist flick range more difficult.
- Proper positioning, pre-aiming, and crosshair placement can help mitigate some of these drawbacks while enhancing strengths, ex. trying to avoid firing angles and situations where you suddenly have to flick to a target outside of your comfortable flick range.
- In some games, like Apex Legends, enemies can begin shooting at you from many different angles and ranges, and once a fight begins, you often have to be able to properly track a moving opponent as you both run, jump, and slide all over the place. Because such situations are core to the game, it may warrant the use of a higher sensitivity. Being slightly off on your initial flick to a target also rarely outright decides the outcome of a fight, due to the movement options available and the Shields which extend the TTK. Additionally, as there is little accuracy penalty for shooting while strafing, strafing can be used to help line up your shots while moving, which can help compensate for the potential difficulty of tracking targets with just mouse movement at higher sensitivities. Apex Legends also has ADS zoom, which can help with longer range engagements that would be difficult to manage with hip-fire alone.
- Sensitivities that are <10 cm/360 (or arguably even <20 cm/360) generally seem too fast to be extremely consistent with, and can be almost physically impossible to be precise with when making tiny corrections and micro-adjustments. At lower mouse CPIs like 400, very high sensitivities can also introduce pixel skipping, which is obviously not desirable.

### Low Sensitivities

- Sensitivities in the Low range allow you to mainly use arm movements, which are more stable than twitchier wrist flicks, for the majority of your aiming. Arm movements are followed by micro-adjustments, which become much more stable at lower sensitivities. 
- Low sensitivities give you the most leniency, stability, and consistency. You are less likely to wildly throw off your aim with imperfect movements of your mouse, and any jitter or variances coming from issues with your setup, ergonomics, physical condition, and so on are minimized.
- Low sensitivities are also arguably the best choice for prioritizing "first flick headshots", as the two-step compound movement of stable arm aiming into precise micro-adjustments enables a high degree of consistency and accuracy on the first shot on a target.
- This comes at the cost of speed and agility, especially when responding to non-ideal situations such as quickly turning towards a target that is shooting at you far from the center of (or off of) your screen, or dealing with close-range engagements. As you are limited in the range that you can cover with wrist aiming, there may also be zones that are outside of your wrist aiming range but still too close to center for comfortable arm aiming.
- Proper positioning, pre-aiming, and crosshair placement can help mitigate some of these drawbacks while enhancing strengths, ex. trying to avoid situations where you might be forced to take a very close-range engagement.
- In some games, like CS:GO, Valorant, or other "tactical" FPS, there is often the potential for one-shot-kill headshots, mobility is (generally) limited, and maps are designed for carefully holding and peeking angles. In these types of games, it becomes more important to quickly and precisely line up your shots with mainly mouse movements, which could make the stability of lower sensitivities more appealing. Making small and compact adjustments to your aim while deadzoning/counter-strafing to shoot while strafing without incurring movement accuracy penalties can also be easier to do with a low sensitivity. Furthermore, these types of games typically give you more control over avoiding non-ideal situations via positioning and utility, potentially reducing the "need" for the benefits of higher sensitivities. It does bear mentioning, however, that Valorant in particular supports ADS zoom on most guns, which could be an argument for a higher base sensitivity compared to a game like CS:GO which does NOT support ADS zoom on most guns. Unlike in CS:GO, ADS can be used in Valorant to situationally zoom in and simulate a more favorable range/effective sensitivity for longer range engagements that would be difficult to manage with hip-fire alone.
- Sensitivities that are >80 cm/360 (or arguably even >70 cm/360) generally seem TOO slow, even for tactical shooters. Past a certain point, the benefits in terms of stability are marginal, and even with proper positioning, pre-aiming, and crosshair placement, you increasingly limit your ability to deal with non-ideal situations. Tracking moving targets becomes more and more difficult, as you have to "fight the sensitivity" to keep up with your target, as well as increasingly needing to lift the mouse to reset on the mousepad for large turns. You also begin seriously sacrificing the ability to use your wrist to make small adjustments or precise flicks as the range comfortably covered by the wrist shrinks to a near-negligible size. 

### Mid Sensitivities

- Sensitivities in the Mid range mix the advantages and disadvantages of High and Low sensitivities. Compared to Low sensitivities, Mid sensitivities are faster and more agile, but sacrifice some of the leniency and stability. Conversely, compared to High sensitivities, Mid sensitivities are more lenient and stable, but sacrifice speed and agility. Mouse movements will typically be made mainly with the wrist (like High sensitivities) when closer to the center of the screen, and made with compound movements consisting of arm movements with adjustments made by the wrist (like Low sensitivities) when further from the center of the screen.
- Mid sensitivities are arguably the best for tracking targets at close-to-mid-range (~5-30 m), compared to High sensitivities where you might struggle not to overshoot your target, and Low sensitivities where you might struggle to keep up with your target. This can be dependent upon the character movement speed in a given game, among other factors.
- Compared to a sensitivity in the High or Low range, a Mid sensitivity can have more of those awkward in-between zones that are outside of your comfortable wrist aiming range but also too close for comfortably arm aiming. The exact zones that could feel awkward for you may vary based on your exact sensitivity and individual anatomy/biomechanics, but these awkward zones would require more careful movements to precisely cover, making them more inefficient and difficult to cover. You can of course practice to cover those zones more consistently, but doing so will always be more prone to error compared to the more comfortable zones.
- Proper positioning, pre-aiming, and crosshair placement can help mitigate some of these drawbacks while enhancing strengths, but arguably not as much compared to High or Low sensitivities, because both the strengths and weaknesses of Mid sensitivities are inherently somewhat diluted by comparison.
- In some games, like Overwatch, TTK is relatively high compared to some other games (character-dependent), and there is no accuracy penalty for shooting while strafing, often leading to drawn out engagements with a lot of tracking and fishing for headshots, which may warrant a Mid sensitivity. Additionally, there are characters who have to deal with targets in various situations at various ranges and do NOT have any ADS options (ex. Cassidy, Hanzo, Soldier: 76, etc.). These kinds of characters will often encounter non-ideal situations where they may have to deal with a close-range character diving in on them, or try to hit shots on a distant target that is difficult to move in on due to protection from their team. As these kinds of situations are frequent and difficult to completely avoid, it is potentially difficult to justify a High or Low sensitivity that would excessively hinder their ability to deal with either the very close-range or far-range situations. On the other hand, there are other characters who DO have ADS zoom options AND are required to make relatively wide flicks while in ADS (ex. Ashe, Widowmaker, Ana, etc.), specialize in closer-range engagements (ex. Genji, Reaper, Tracer, etc.), or even don't rely on precision aim at all (ex. Reinhardt, Moira, etc.). For these characters, it seems reasonable to potentially justify playing them on higher sensitivities, as they are effectively playing a completely different game.

## TL;DR

- Just don't think about it too hard, it's too confusing if you're dumb like me.
- **Just go into Aim Lab, plug in your base mouse sensitivity and FOV values, and follow the instructions above to find out what ADS sensitivity multiplier values you need to plug in to get 0% monitor match scaling.**
- **NOTE: For games like Valorant that do not have individual sensitivity sliders for each and every zoom level/optic, you will have to choose one optic to "sync up" with.**

## Assorted Quotes/Explanations

> If you were to use the exact same sensitivity in these two examples, the lower FOV option would feel exceedingly fast and hard to control, despite the cm/360 being identical. This is because the pixels per degree are vastly different. Despite moving 1 degree in both examples, the pixels traveled is immensely different.
> 
> This is precisely why scopes have sensitivity multipliers to make them slower. If you use the same cm/360 when zooming in, things suddenly feel too fast. This also goes both ways, 30cm/360 on 90 HFOV may feel like a mid to low range sensitivity. But 30cm/360 will likely feel significantly faster when playing on 120 HFOV.

> For example, using 50% horizontal monitor match will make the mouse movement needed to flick to the middle between your crosshair and the edge of your screen EXACTLY THE SAME, regardless if you are scoping or not.
> 
> So, why 0% monitor match is considered the best ?
> 
> The answer is quite simple : the farther you are from the monitor match distance point, the greater the innacuracy will be. As you usually need to do very small flickshots when scoping, 0% is the way to go in most situations. Furthermore, THIS 0% IS THE SAME FOR EVERY SCREEN RATIO (4:3, 16:9, 16:10, 21:9 ...).
> 
> You can still use another monitor match if it doesn't fit you, I know many players who prefer to use 100% horizontal monitor match distance.

> The reason why you can judge distances properly with 0% is because the distance scales with the zoom. If you zoom in 2x, the target will be 2x further away [sic] on your screen; should say "0.5 the distance away on your screen"], and will require 2x more mouse movement to flick to compared to before the zoom. If you make this a fair comparison and scale the distance between you and the target to counteract the zoom, then the mouse distances will be the same. This will also benefit tracking, since the perceived movement speed, size, and distance of the movement will scale with the zoom, and so will the sensitivity. So if the distance between you and the target scales with the zoom also, then a target will move the same speed across your screen, and require the exact same mouse movement.

> Match distance isn't "accurate within a circle." Any match distance will only be perfectly matched at that specific distance and just get more and more off the further you are from it, whether it's more inside or outside. However distance match only works when you're starting at 0° horizontal. I.e. if you're aiming up or down at all, even a little bit, then the concept of a distance being matched stops working entirely.
> 
> The big reason to use "0% distance" is that it's actually scaling by zoom ratio aka focal length. This is desirable most obviously because you're, well... scaling by the zoom. 2x zoom means 1/2 sensitivity. A secondary reason this is desirable is that this mimics how your brain automatically scales aiming based on distance from target. E.g. if a target moves from 100 meters to 50 meters then you have to move your mouse 2x the distance to stay on target. The target will also appear 2x as large since it's half the distance away (kind of like 2x zoom).

> "0% isnt a distance, so it wont 'distance match' to some point on the screen. The matching points won't be a ring either, but a single point at each pole.
> 
> 0% scales the sensitivity by the things that actually change, such as zoom and curvature, so it preserves your sensitivity and it's just the curvature of the image that makes it behave differently.
> 
> Pretend you are at the center of a sphere. You can think of 2D as 0 fov, an infinitely zoomed in, infinitely flat portion of a sphere is on your screen. As you raise the fov, you zoom out, revealing more of the sphere. The physical size of the sphere reduces as you zoom out, and the curvature within the physical space that is your monitor increases. This change in zoom and curvature is what 0% is scaling the sensitivity by.
> 
> You traverse a pretty flat image at low fovs, and a highly curved image at high fovs. Then you also have the size of the sphere changing, so low fovs require long distances and high fov require short distances to rotate 360 degrees. No matter what, it will always be a different experience at different fovs. 0% will properly scale the sensitivity itself, but you still have these factors changing the experience. This is where you try other match % to try and make it feel more comfortable, but I wouldn't decide what % to use based on some distance rule as the distance thing has pretty much no benefits."

## Left/Right Lean Keybinds

- (From some YouTube comment) "For a more basic config, leaning is often on Q and E. Try swapping Q and E around. You'll get used to leaning right with Q and left with E quite quickly (within a few hours max). The advantage is that you can peek around a corner moving right (D) while leaning right (Q), then when you need to get back in cover moving left you let go of lean automatically. This is 100% better than not swapping and works well enough for slower paced games. For faster paced games there are likely more efficient (more exotic) configs possible."

## Excerpts


### Voltaic - Aim Journey

> HOW CAN AIM TRAINING IMPROVE YOUR GAMEPLAY?
> - You may be able to hit shots and track targets more consistently
> - You may enable new opportunities for you to outplay your opponents
> - You may be able to read your target’s movements better
> - You may have better overall control of your mouse, including in non-aim situations

> WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT AIM TRAINING WON’T DO?
> - You won’t have better positioning.
> - You won’t have better decision-making.
> - You won’t be better at anything that can be considered part of “game sense,” game-specific mechanics, or most other non-aim related skills.
> 
> If something besides aim is significantly holding back your performance, aim-training isn’t going to be your best option. Many people do have poor aim, and aim can always be better, but before you train your aim, you should ask yourself, “Is aiming really the skill I need to work on?”
> 
> To further integrate this concept for you to remember, we’re going to repeat it once more: Aim-training will not make you better at games unless aim is specifically a skill that’s holding you back when playing. Luckily, aiming is a fundamental skill in most shooter games. Improved aim will often result in some overall improvement, but that does not make aiming a magic solution for becoming skilled or successful.

> WHAT ADVANTAGES DOES AIM TRAINING HAVE OVER ORDINARY GAMEPLAY?
> - Isolation: You can practice a specific skill without distractions.
> - Repetition: You can practice the same skills over and over quickly.
> - Customization: You can practice any scenario within the limits of the trainer.
> - Feedback: You can easily get information about your progress.
> 
> If you are someone who goes to the gym, these advantages might sound similar to the reasons why many forms of exercise are effective, and it can be helpful to use this analogy when thinking about aim training. Aim training lets you build up the fundamentals you need to perform in your main game, just like how weightlifting can help you build the strength you need to become a better athlete

### Woohoojin - "Valorant is absolutely not a game that requires perfected levels of aim."

> Hey hoojers,
> 
> We've decided to permanently close the aim training discussion channel.
> 
> I don't intend to argue that there is absolutely 0 value in understanding the ins and outs of aim training.
> There's a link at the bottom of this message to a Discord server full of endless aim training knowledge.
> But before you click and enter the rabbit hole - hear me out.
> 
> When it comes down to it - Valorant is absolutely not a game that requires perfected levels of aim.
> Compare the raw aim capability of a player like TenZ, to one like FNS.
> Despite having a ridiculously palpable gap of raw aim skill between them,
> they both compete at the same high level of Valorant.
> 
> I've been down the entire aim training rabbit hole.
> DPI deviation, Raw Accel, Sensitivity Randomizers, Muscle Memory, Custom Mouse Modifications,
> Artisan Mousepads, Bardpills, Voltaic, Aimer7.... the list is ENDLESS.
> 
> If you joined this server with the goal of achieving a higher rank in Valorant, you gotta trust me on this one.
> Looking into this stuff is such a gargantuan waste of time.
> Will it make your raw aim better? Yep.
> But you'll still bot frag in Plat until you put some of that time into the other 99.5% of the game.
> 
> I would've hit Immortal at least twice as fast if I had had an appropriate mentor during my climb to steer me clear of this road.
> 
> Here's my final advice on this topic for those of you who are willing to trust me and focus on Valorant:
> 
> 1. Use an eDPI between 190 and 320.
> 2. Use a large, slow mousepad (Zowie GS-R is good and cheap)
> 3. Save up for a superlight if you don't have an fps mouse already
> 4. Spend 45 minutes finding an aim training playlist you enjoy (I have one on my youtube channel)
> 5. Stop thinking about it. Play that playlist once a day, really try to push your scores.
> 
> For those of you who insist on discussing aim training beyond that - your discussion is no longer welcome here.
> It stunts the growth of the impressionable minds of this Discord.
> I don't want Timmy in Silver 2 to waste their time reading about Raw Accel
> because one of you couldn't resist sharing that it's definitely the secret to your success (it's not.)
> 
> Here's where you should go instead, they will welcome you with open arms: https://discord.com/invite/voltaic
