# Adjusting Microphone Gain

- Control Panel > Sound > Recording > Microphone > Properties > Levels > Increase microphone gain
- Increasing your gain at the source is the best way to boost your mic volume, but you should only boost the gain up to a point before it begins to significantly amplify background noise.
- After setting this baseline gain level, you can further boost it in software (ex. applying a Gain filter in OBS)

# VoiceMeeter Banana

## Windows Sound Setup

- Control Panel > Sound > Playback > Set VoiceMeeter Input as Default Device
- Control Panel > Sound > Playback > Set VoiceMeeter Aux Input as Default Communications Device
- Control Panel > Sound > Recording > Set VoiceMeeter Output as Default Device
- Control Panel > Sound > Recording > Set VoiceMeeter Aux Output as Default Communications Device
- *Settings > System > Sound > App volume and device preferences (Can separately set audio input/output to something other than the default for applications that don't let you change them within their own settings (ex. routing internet browser audio to Virtual Cable))* (Optional)

## Basic VoiceMeeter Settings

- Menu > Check "Auto Restart Audio Engine"
- Menu > Check "System Tray (Run at Startup)"

## Audio Input/Output Setup

- Begin with A1 through B2 unchecked for all Hardware Inputs and Virtual Inputs.
- Hardware Out A1 > Select primary headphones/speakers (Choose the WDM version if available for best performance and lowest latency)
- Hardware Input 1 > Change name to "Mic"
- Hardware Input 3 > Change name to "Discord"
- VoiceMeeter VAIO > Change name to "Desktop"
- VoiceMeeter AUX > Change name to "Voice"
- Mic > Select microphone input (Choose the WDM version if available for best performance and lowest latency)
- Discord > Select CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable) (effectively creates another Virtual Input to use for selectively routing audio in OBS or other applications)
- Discord, Desktop, and Voice > Check: A1 (Sends incoming audio to Hardware Out A1)
- Mic > Check: B2 (Sends incoming audio to VoiceMeeter Aux Output)

### Source Aliases

- Mic = VoiceMeeter Aux Output
- Discord = CABLE Output
- Desktop = VoiceMeeter Input
- Other Voice = VoiceMeeter Aux Input

## In Discord

- Input Device: VoiceMeeter Aux Output
- Output Device: CABLE Input

## In Games And Other Voice Applications

- (Voice Chat) Input Device: VoiceMeeter Aux Output
- (Voice Chat) Output Device: VoiceMeeter Aux Input

## Reducing Audio Latency

- (In Sound Control Panel, for each device) Properties > Advanced > Default Format > Match the sample rate of all input and output devices (ex. if mic goes up to 48 kHz, match other devices at 48 kHz)
- VoiceMeeter Banana > Menu > System Settings/Options > Make sure that the sample rate of all input and output devices match.
- VoiceMeeter Banana > Menu > System Settings/Options > Try lowering buffer size (256 is probably safe) and/or switching Engine Mode to Swift (experimental)

## Troubleshooting

- If having issues with audio, try Menu > "Restart Audio Engine"

# OBS
