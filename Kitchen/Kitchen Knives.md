# Knife Geometry

- The primary factors that go into knife geometry/profile are: overall shape/length, blade thickness (from spine to bezel), blade height, curvature of the edge, and curvature of the sides.
- **Overall shape/length:** Self-explanatory. Determines the primary profile characteristics of the knife, such as how well it is suited to slicing, chopping, and rocking motions.
- **Blade thickness:** The main balancing factor between durability and cutting efficiency. Thickness is also related to weight, which directly translates to force.
- **Blade height:** Affects things such as knuckle clearance, effectiveness at scooping ingredients, friction (due to surface area) and so on. A taller knife is more effective at chopping and scooping, while a shorter knife (in terms of height) offers more control and less friction as it cuts.
- **Edge curvature:** Affects the balance between chopping (flat edge) and rocking (curved edge) motion efficiency.
- **Sides curvature:** Affects friction while cutting due to surface area. Having convex or concave side grind (or scalloped indentations, such as in Granton knives) reduces friction while cutting.

# Choosing a Knife (or Knives)

## Examples of Core Knife Sets

- Typical Western chef (home and pro): Western-style chef's knife, petty and/or paring knife 
- Traditional Japanese pro chef: deba, yanagiba, and usuba/nakiri.
- Typical Japanese home chef: santoku/gyuutou, nakiri, petty and/or paring knife.
- Typical Chinese home chef: One "slicer" cai dao and one "chopper" cai dao (or a single all-rounder), petty and/or paring knife.

## Practical Recommendations for Home Cooks

- For starters, avoid knives with full bolsters (unless its something like a cheap paring knife), as they are a pain to properly sharpen.
- My personal recommendation for a single, do-it-all starter knife is a decent **cai dao (~200mm).** After that, I would consider a **gyuutou (~240mm),** either a **petty knife (~150mm)** or a **paring knife (~80-100mm),** and a **serrated bread knife.** This makes for a solid set of knives to cover most typical use cases in the home kitchen.
- **Cai dao (Chinese chef's knife (or "Chinese cleaver")):** Specifically, an "all-purpose" or "slicer" type (such as a pian dao or sang dao) with a decently substantial spine thickness (more than 2mm). Cai dao make for great general use, all-purpose knives, but their width and mostly flat edge make them particularly well suited as workhorse knives for things like chopping and push cutting vegetables, mincing and smashing garlic or ginger, etc. Their size also makes them very convenient to safely guide with your knuckles, and to use for transferring food from the cutting board without reaching for a bench scraper. Compared to usuba/nakiri, the cai dao is generally more versatile when it comes to cutting vegetables, though perhaps not as delicate. Because the typical Chinese cleaver is meant to be continually used, abused, and re-sharpened as necessary, it typically does not benefit as much from finer, harder steels, and you might actually be better off with one made with a softer steel that is more easily sharpened.
- **Gyuutou (Japanese-style Western chef's knife):** Much like standard Western chef's knives, gyuutou are great as general purpose knives. They are well suited to various cutting styles, such as chopping, slicing, and rocking. However, as they are typically thinner and lighter than their Western counterparts, they are best suited for more precise work, almost like a petty knife. As the name implies (roughly, "beef knife"), the gyuutou excels at slicing meat. Because gyuutou excel at work that requires clean, precise cuts, picking one with good, hard steel that will hold a keen edge for a long time is beneficial.
- **Petty knife:** With their short and thin blades, petty knives are small enough to work with in the hand, and are great for covering any finer or delicate work, such as slicing fruit, or removing blemishes. However, they are also substantial enough to use on the cutting board for any task where the larger knives might feel unwieldy.
- **Paring knife:** The paring knife is even shorter and thinner than the petty knife, and is primarily suited for delicate work or working in hand. Because the petty knife is less versatile than other types of knives and will mainly be used for these kinds of tasks, the quality of the steel is not as important, and a cheaper one will do the job just fine in most cases.
- **Bread knife:** The serrated blade of a bread knife is good not just for cutting bread, but for sawing through anything hard and dense, like cheese, or anything else with a tough exterior that would be rough on other knives, such as pineapples or melons.
- Additional knives to consider beyond these include (depending on your needs): meat cleaver, boning knife, long meat/fish slicing knife, etc.
- Other useful tools to complement your knives include: vegetable peeler, kitchen shears, graters/zesters, etc.

# Knife Skills and Techniques

- When chopping or slicing ingredients, always hold food with your free hand in a claw grip,  **keeping the fingers of your non-cutting hand curled INWARDS while holding the ingredients,** and keeping the knife close against the knuckles.
- Guide the knife blade against your knuckles as you move them back with each cut, and **never let the knife rise above the knuckles.**
- For general finer knife control, use the "pinch/blade grip", with your middle finger resting squarely against the choil at the base of the blade, the thumb gripping one side of the blade near the handle, and the index finger wrapped around the handle on the other side. If this is uncomfortable due to a rough choil section, consider lightly sanding that area with sandpaper.
- When using a cai dao to rock chop small items like garlic or ginger ("low technique"), you may want to shift your grip to a "peace sign" grip. Compared to a standard pinch grip, the hand is moved up the handle so that the ring finger is wrapped around the handle at or near the choil, the middle finger is mostly extended and roughly parallel to or a bit above/below the choil, and the index finger follows through with the middle finger, fully extended against the side of the blade and forming a peace sign. This grip shifts the center of gravity and axis of rotation towards the center of the blade for more efficient small rocking cuts.
- When using a petty or paring knife for detail work, you may want want to shift your grip so that your index finger rests on the spine of the knife, giving you more control.
- In general, the smaller the pieces that meat or vegetables are cut into, the faster the cooking time, and the more surface area there is for seasoning or browning.
- Cutting meat or vegetables into larger pieces preserves more moisture/juiciness, more "natural" flavor, and has different texture and mouthfeel than more finely cut pieces.
- Cutting at angles/slants/biases is a generally useful technique that can be applied to all kinds of foods. It increases the surface area of the food, which can be situationally useful for seasoning, browning, etc.

# Knife Care

- Sharpen your knives on whetstones when needed as they inevitably dull with use.
- After preliminary sharpening and before first use, lightly coat the knife in tsubaki or mineral oil. Occasionally repeat this process, especially before long-term storage, in order to prevent rusting. Also do this for wooden handles.
- Always thoroughly dry a knife after it is used and washed. This is especially important for carbon steel or otherwise high-carbon knives in order to prevent rusting.
- Ideally, don't put a knife away into a block or drawer until it is completely cleaned and dried.
- Preferably, use cutting boards made of softer materials, such as those made from softer woods, or specifically made synthetic materials like Hi-Soft. This helps to preserve the edges on knives.
- You can also use thin, soft, flexible plastic cutting boards layered on top of the main cutting board to "take the hit" for the main cutting board. This has the added benefit of managing cross-contamination risks without having to wash the same cutting board over and over between ingredients.

# Sharpening Knives

- At a minimum, you need a medium (~#1000) grit whetstone. In addition to that, you can add things such as a fine grit (~#5000-6000) stone, a coarse grit stone (~#300-500), a fixing/flattening stone, a nagura stone, and a honing rod.
- When sharpening, start with the medium grit whetstone unless the knife is particularly dull.
- (Optional) Mark the bevel of the knife edge with a Sharpie or other marker so you can tell when that section has been worn away.
- Wet the whetstone as necessary.
- (Optional) Use the fixing or nagura stones to clean and flatten the whetstone before use as necessary.
- Position the knife on the whetstone with the blade facing away from you. You may want to angle the whetstone so that it is easier to run the whole edge of the knife across it without the handle getting in the way.
- Angle the knife against the whetstone so as to preserve the existing or desired bezels (50/50, 70/30, etc.).
- Apply moderate pressure (up to ~4-6 lbs as measured with a kitchen scale) to the knife against the whetstone, with fingers/thumbs distributed such that the pressure is fairly even across the knife.
- When sharpening, glide the knife back and forth along the whetstone, only applying pressure when PULLING towards you.
- Sharpen in small sections at a time, rather than gliding across the whole edge at once.
- When sharpening near a curved tip (ex. the tip of a gyutou/chef's knife, or either end of a cleaver), tilt the knife sideways just a bit towards that end to more aggressively grind the tip.
- More complete passes across the whole edge can be made once each section has been sharpened separately.
- Once a burr has formed along the opposite side's edge, the knife can be flipped over and the other side can be sharpened (either swap which hand is on the handle, or just flip the knife around).
- Wash and wipe off debris from the knife and stone, then repeat the above steps on the opposite side.
- Continue sharpening each side as necessary, with progressively less pressure as you begin to "finish" the edge.
- (Optional) For harder knives (~60 HRC or higher), or for knives you just want a particularly keen edge on (such as a paring knife), switch to the fine grit stone and sharpen each side again, but with very light pressure.
- Wash and wipe off debris from the knife and stone.
- Repeat the steps as needed. You may need to go back to the medium stone to adjust the edge you have created.
- (Optional) For softer knives (~60 HRC or lower), carefully use a honing rod to further even out the edge and create a micro-bevel. Start with the heel of the knife against the heel of the rod, and PUSH (unlike using a whetstone) and slide until the tip of the knife reaches the tip of the rod. Be careful not to crush or deform the edge with too much pressure. Using a honing rod is not recommended on knives made with harder steels. When in doubt, stick to the whetstones.
- Most serrated knives, such as bread knives, will stay sharp for years, since the main cutting surface(s) usually aren't coming into contact with the cutting board. If you want/need to sharpen a serrated knife, consider getting a sharpening rod.
