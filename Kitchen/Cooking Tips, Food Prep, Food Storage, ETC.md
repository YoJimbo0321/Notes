# General Cookware Care and Cooking Cleanup

## General Tips

- When preheating any empty cookware, start with medium to medium-high heat, then adjust as needed after a minute or two. **DON'T immediately heat at the highest setting,** as the sharp temperature differentials can cause cookware to warp.
- Similarly, when cleaning any cookware after use, **DON'T immediately dunk it into cold water while still hot.** Either let it cool down naturally, or SLOWLY pour lukewarm water into the cookware to cool it quicker.
- DON'T use anything more abrasive than regular dish soap and a typical dish brush on seasoned or coated non-stick cookware, or the coating could be ruined.
- In general, scrub pots and pans with warm water, a regular dish cloth or sponge, and dish soap.
- For tougher residue that regular dish soap won't scrub off, use Bar Keepers Friend with a scouring cloth and a bit of water.
- If even that doesn't work (ex. for burnt-on stains), try boiling 1:1 diluted vinegar in the cookware to soften up any residue. Scrape away as much as you can, then wash off the cookware.
- Then, pour some more water into the cookware along with some baking soda, mix it into a paste, and use a ball of aluminum foil to scrub away the remaining residue.

## Lining and Seasoning Aluminium Baking Sheets

- Much like cast iron or carbon steel, aluminium cookware, including baking sheets, benefits from being seasoned. This also means that there is no need for heavy duty scrubbing of the sheet most of the time, just a regular cleaning with soap and water.
- Note that while a heavily seasoned baking sheet is beneficial for quicker and more even browning when roasting, it isn't always ideal for more delicate tasks like baking pastries, as it could cause the bottoms to brown more than desired, possibly getting burnt.
- For tasks like baking, consider lining the baking sheet with foil, and/or  sliding a flat cookie sheet under the baking sheet halfway through to provide insulation and reduce browning on the bottom.
- For tasks like broiling, especially for wet marinades, consider lining the baking sheet with foil to prevent residue from sticking to the sheet and getting burnt on.

### Seasoning Steps

- First, choose a neutral cooking oil with a relatively high smoke point (canola oil recommended).
- If using canola oil, preheat the oven to ~375F. For other oils, the oven temperature should be lower than but reasonably close to the oil's smoke point (as low as ~25F below). This is to make the polymerization process go faster without excessively denaturing the oil.
- Using a paper towel or microfiber cloth, soak lightly in canola oil (or other high smoke point oil), and thoroughly and evenly coat the entire surface of the sheet, inside and out.
- **IMPORTANT** Make sure that the oil coating on the sheet is VERY THIN. There should not be any visible dripping, beading, or pooling oil. The surface should look and feel almost dry.
- (Optional) Line another baking sheet with aluminum foil, and place it on the bottom rack of the oven to catch any stray drippings.
- Place the sheet upside down on a middle rack (to prevent oil pooling) and bake it for 30-60 minutes.
- Flip the sheet over, then bake again for another 30-60 minutes.
- Remove the sheet from the oven and let cool.
- Lightly wash the sheet with warm water and soap. You can scrub away any heavy oil residue, but spots that are lightly tacky to the touch are okay to leave untouched, as they will continue to polymerize with use.
- Wipe the sheet dry with a cloth.
- If desired, repeat the oiling, baking, and washing process a total of 2 or 3 times, making sure that every new layer of oil is just as thin.

## Using the Dishwasher

- Make sure that all items you put in the dishwasher are dishwasher-safe. Cookware and any other non-dishwasher-safe items should be washed by hand.
- Scrape off any solid bits of food remaining on the items, but don't worry about pre-rinsing (pre-rinsing can actually make dishwasher soap perform worse).
- Put more delicate items on the top rack, further away from the heating element (again, after confirming that they are dishwasher-safe in the first place).
- Generally, stick to the standard settings on the dishwasher.

## Caring for Wooden Kitchenware (Wooden Spoons, etc.)

- Before first use, coat the wooden item in mineral oil. Once the oil soaks in, add another layer, focuses on any spots that look drier.
- Repeat the first step until the oil has soaked thoroughly into the wood, and wipe off any excess.
- Let dry for at least 24 hours, and go back to the first step if the item doesn't seem seasoned enough yet.
- Make sure to thoroughly scrub wooden items after use to minimize the need to deep clean them.
- If there are lingering scents on the wooden item, try scrubbing with a paste of baking soda and water. Let sit for a few minutes before thoroughly rinsing off.
- If that doesn't work, bring a pot of heavily diluted vinegar (as in mostly water, a bit of vinegar) to a boil, then take off the heat, place the wooden item(s) in the water, and let sit for about 15-30 minutes.
- Occasionally repeat the oiling process as the item begins to dries out from use.

## Removing Lingering Scents From Silicone Kitchenware (Spatulas, Ice Cube Tray Covers, Instant Pot Gasket, etc.)

- Firstly, make sure that the items are actually heatproof.
- Preheat oven to 250F.
- Wash items with soap and water first to get rid of oils and residue.
- Place items on a baking sheet and "bake" for 20-30 minutes or so. Check after 20 minutes to see if the scent has dissipated.

## Disposing of Oil

- DON'T pour large quantities of oil down the kitchen sink drain, it accumulates down the pipeline and can contribute to clogs.
- Instead, pour unneeded oil into a grease bin bag or other sealable container, seal when full, and toss in the trash.

# General Food Prep and Cooking Tips

## Keeping Prep Area Organized and Clean

- **"Mise en Place."** Keep the kitchen workspace clean and uncluttered with separate prep bowls and vessels for various utensils, ingredients, seasonings, scraps, and so on.
- To save space, try to pick items that nest, stack, and/or share pieces (ex. different sized containers with the same size lid).
- Baking quarter sheet pans are very versatile and useful. Compared to the standard half sheet pan size, they can more easily be used in the freezer, as ingredient prep trays, and to separate batches or different ingredients in the oven. They are also much easier to wash in a crowded sink.
- Use squeeze bottles for commonly used oils/condiments/sauces, and keep them in the fridge or on the countertop as needed. That way, you can prep sauces in advance and have them ready to go, buy things in bulk and keep them away from the main cooking area (to preserve freshness), and so on.
- Mark containers and bottles with removable sticker labels with names, expiration dates, etc.
- Regularly wipe kitchen surfaces with cleaners before and after use, to prevent messes and residue from building up and drying out, making them harder to clean.
- To prevent cross-contamination, use separate cutting boards when possible for meat and vegetables. Otherwise, thoroughly wash any cutting board that was used for meat before using it for something else.
- Wash hands thoroughly between steps.

## Measuring Ingredients by Weight

- While it is good to have a set of measuring cups and spoons for both liquid and dry ingredients, it is ultimately better to transition to measuring by weight on a kitchen scale, especially for dry ingredients.
- Measuring dry ingredients by volume is very unreliable given the varying compressibility of each ingredient (ex. 1 cup of fine grain table salt tends to be almost twice the weight of 1 cup of large flake kosher salt).
- The measuring cups and spoons are best used as an initial benchmarking tool for an ingredient or recipe, after which the kitchen scale should be used based on those initial measurements.
- Using the kitchen scale also allows for precise measurements when combining ingredients in the same bowl, taking advantage of the tare function to zero the weight between each ingredient.

## Heat Retention and "Momentum" of Food

- Heat retention and transfer plays an important role for all kinds of foods, both for cooking and serving.
- When baking a steak as per the reverse-sear method, the steak should be removed before the target temperature is reached (typically ~15F before the final target temp is reached), as the hot exterior will continue to cook the interior after it is removed.
- Also relevant to reverse-seared steaks, thick cast iron pans are notable for their heat retention, which is a result of their poor heat conduction (slow to heat, slow to cool). This makes them well suited for certain tasks, like searing a steak.
- Recipes for soft and fluffy scrambled eggs often advise to take the eggs out of the pan when they are still just a bit runny, as the residual heat will continue to cook them.
- Blanching vegetables ideally involves draining the vegetables from the boiling water an ice water bath, which cools them down quickly and halts the cooking process.
- Before serving, warming a plate in the oven can help to keep a hot dish hot, and putting a plate in the freezer can help to keep a cold dish cold (raw fish, dessert, etc.).
- There are many other examples, but in general keeping the "momentum" of heat retention in mind can be beneficial to prevent overcooking, lukewarm serving temperatures, and so on.

## Cooking with Tap Water (and Contaminant Risks)

- NEVER USE HOT TAP WATER FOR COOKING OR DRINKING.
- Though it may be tempting to make water boil faster, always start with cold tap water, never warm or hot water.
- The reason for this is that hot water is more likely to leach lead or other contaminants from old and/or corroded pipes along the way, and those contaminants will still be there even if the water is boiled.

## Preparing Meat

- Generally, **DON'T rinse any raw meat in the sink.** It is not very effective at cleaning off bacteria, and can actually spread it and contaminate surfaces. This is ESPECIALLY dangerous for chicken, which can spread salmonella.
- Pounding meat with a meat mallet tenderizes it, and can also help with flattening cuts for faster or more even cooking.
- Before cutting meat, you may want to put it into the freezer for 15-30 minutes (depending on the freezer and meat) to firm up the surface, making it much easier to slice. Note that this is not the same as "half-thawing" a frozen piece of a meat. A half-thawed piece of meat will be thawed on the outside, frozen on the inside, which is not ideal. A thawed piece of meat that is put into the freezer will only be frozen on the outer surface layers.
- For tougher cuts of meat, cutting or scoring across the grain of muscle fibers can also help to tenderize the meat. The more perpendicular to the grain you cut, the more muscle fibers are severed. You can also score meat in a diamond grid pattern.
- Slicing directly across the grain is generally not recommended for thinner cuts of softer meats, like chicken, as it makes it easier for the meat to fall apart.
- Adding a small amount of baking soda (~1/2 tsp per pound of meat) to a marinade can help tenderize meat as well.

## Parboiling/"Parsteaming" and Blanching

- Parboiling (and blanching) is a method for "pre-cooking" something before adding it to a dish, or minimally cooking it to preserve fresh flavors and nutrients.
- Good for greens like broccoli and asparagus, as well as potatoes, depending on the recipe.
- To parboil, partially fill a pot or pan with enough water to submerge whatever you're using (optionally adding a bit of salt for taste), then bring the water to a boil.
- For greens, place into the boiling water for a minute or two, until they turn a vibrant green. For potatoes, cook to the desired level of doneness.
- Remove items from the water and strain them. 
- To blanch, follow all of the same steps, but prepare a large bowl of ice water beforehand, then dunk the items into the ice water bath immediately after straining, in order to quickly "set"/halt the cooking and prevent overcooking and sogginess.
- To "parsteam", follow all of the same steps, just with less water so that the veggies aren't fully submerged, and stirring so that they cook evenly. This works well for things like broccoli that you just want to quickly pre-cook a bit in a wok before stir-frying.

## Pre-Cooking Mushrooms

- Mushrooms retain a lot of liquid, which then gets expelled as they are cooked, which can make the food watery or soggy.
- To prevent this, chop the mushrooms and pre-cook them by sauteing them in a pan on high heat, with enough water to coat the bottom of the pan.
- As the mushrooms steam in the pan, they will expel their liquids and collapse, making them significantly less absorbent. It is very difficult to overcook mushrooms this way.
- Once the mushrooms have given up their liquids, they can be strained and sauteed once again with oil, or added to other ingredients.
- This method also makes it much more convenient to wash mushrooms in the sink with water instead of carefully dry brushing them, as there is no need to worry about water retention.

## Rice Cooker Tips

- Typically, .5 cups uncooked white rice = 1 cup cooked = 1 serving (depends on the rice and individual, so adjust as needed).
- For most white rice, generally rinse and drain once or twice first to remove any excess starch/debris.
- For rice that is enriched and coated with additional nutrients, follow the instructions on the packaging. Some enriched rice is not supposed to be washed, else those nutrients and such will be washed away.

## Pasta Cooking Tips

- Always season your pasta water to taste with salt, mostly just to make the pasta taste better, rather than for any supposed functional benefits to the boil.
- If unsure of how much salt to add, a rough rule of thumb is 1% of the dry pasta's weight in salt.
- Adding leftover starchy pasta water to pasta sauce helps the sauce thicken (similar to a cornstarch slurry) and emulsify (in the case of buttery or oily sauces).
- Because the pasta water is salted, be conservative about how much of it you throw into the sauce. You can add more plain, unsalted water if you still need to add water to thin the sauce and simmer it longer.
- For better control over the pasta's doneness level (i.e. to achieve optimal al dente texture), you can take the pasta out of the boiling water early and mix with the sauce. As you finish cooking the sauce, the pasta will cook slower than it would have in the boiling water, giving you easier control over the final result.

## General Saute and Stir-Fry Tips

- Use an oil with a high smoke point, such as canola oil or peanut oil (note that there is a good chance that the oil will still smoke at a high enough heat when stir-frying).
- "Longyau", or "Hot Wok, Cold Oil." Before sauteing or stir-frying in a wok or pan, preheat it while empty on medium-high heat without adding oil, and wait until it is very hot. This helps to create a non-stick cooking surface. The main reason to wait and add the oil AFTER preheating is just to limit how much the oil might smoke and denature before cooking begins.
- To test for proper pre-heating temperature, you can try the Leidenfrost effect test with a small spoonful of water. The ideal result is a single gliding bead of water that holds its shape. If the water spreads normally or sizzles away quickly, the temperature is too low, and you should continue preheating. If the water rapidly splits into many small gliding beads, the temperature may be too high, and the heat should be reduced, and the wok/pan taken off the burner to cool for a few seconds. Alternatively, you can add the oil earlier and wait until it begins to "shimmer" or form waves.
- If, however, you are stir-frying in a wok, don't worry about overheating. Woks are designed for stir-frying on commercial burners that get much hotter than the typical home range can produce, and the food is stirred frequently enough to prevent.
- Once the wok or pan has been fully preheated, add the oil, turn off the heat, then swirl and spread the oil to coat the cooking surface.
- Turn the heat back on and adjust to the appropriate cooking temperature for whatever you are cooking (ex. low for fried eggs).
- Avoid overcrowding the pan to prevent steaming and sogginess. This means cooking ingredients separately and/or cooking in batches, each time allowing the wok/pan to fully reheat, then adding and heating the oil, then adding the ingredients.
- When stir-frying, cut ingredients into small enough pieces to cook quickly.
- When stir-frying in a work on a home stovetop or burner, you don't need to constantly stir the food. It's best to let the food sit for a bit initially (~10-30 seconds) before starting to stir, to let the heat transfer and start searing the food.

## Braising, Stewing, and Hong Shao "Red Cooking" Tips

- Braising is a hybrid dry and wet method of cooking that involves searing/browning meat or vegetables at high heat first, then simmering at low heat for a long time, partially submerged in liquid (unlike stewing, which calls for full submersion of ingredients).
- Braising is particularly useful for breaking down tougher/cheaper cuts of meat to make them tender.
- Braising (and stewing) can technically be done in any vessel, but dutch ovens are recommended for their shape and heat retention properties, which lend themselves particularly well to sear-then-simmer tasks.
- Note that while meat continues to break down and become more tender as it is cooked longer/hotter, it can also become very dry, even when submerged in liquid. This is due to excessive break down of the muscle fibers and the loss of the ability to retain juices. In other words, it is very possible to overcook a stew/braise.
- Cooking "low and slow" (low heat simmer, longer cooking time) is ideal for achieving the best texture and juiciness, and also makes it easier to pinpoint the right stage of meat breakdown.
- Simmering with a completely covered lid retains the most moisture and prevents the liquid from reducing too much. However, this also raises the equilibrium temperature, which can cause cause the meat to overcook, and hinders additional browning of meat.
- Simmering completely uncovered keeps the equilibrium temperature down, and allows the surface of meat to continue to brown as it dries. However, this can cause the liquid to evaporate and reduce faster than desired.
- Though an inexact method, the fastest and easiest way to deal with this is simply to simmer with the lid cracked open a bit, leaving a small opening for some steam to escape.
- For braising specifically, an alternative is to make a cover out of parchment paper to sit on top of the partially submerged meat, cutting a hole so that some steam can escape.

## Salt (and Iodine Deficiency Risks)

- Table salts typically have significantly higher bulk density than kosher salts with large flakes (such as Diamond Crystal).
- Roughly speaking, **"A cup of table salt will have twice the salting power of a cup of Diamond Crystal kosher salt."**
- When trying a recipe that calls for any significant amount of (unspecified) salt for the first time, it should generally be assumed that they mean kosher salt. In other words, use HALF of what is called for (in volume) if you're using table salt. You can adjust to taste with subsequent attempts.
- Alternatively, you can salt by weight instead of volume, and use equal amounts of any salt in grams.
- Kosher salt is often favored by cooks over table salt because is it easier to pinch, sprinkle, and evenly spread. It can also add some texture when used as a finishing salt, and may have less of a metallic/chemical aftertaste compared to iodized table salt.
- On its own, table salt's main benefit is that it dissolves a little bit faster in liquids due to smaller crystals. However, the most important benefit is that table salt tends to be iodized.
- Iodized table salt is one of the easiest ways to add iodine to your diet.
- **Kosher salt, as a less processed product, is NOT fortified with iodine, which means increasing risk of iodine deficiencies if you don't eat enough of the right foods (mostly seaweed, seafood, and dairy).**
- Unless you eat a fair amount of seaweed (ex. Japanese/Korean diet) or a huge amount of seafood and dairy products, it is unlikely that you are getting enough iodine without using iodized salt, even from an otherwise balanced diet.
- Additionally, though some claim that eating vegetables can also give you enough iodine, that is an unreliable source. Iodine content in vegetables is extremely dependent upon the condition of the soil that they were grown in, and even in the best case may not be enough to meet daily recommended values with normal consumption.
- If you decide to use kosher salt over iodized table salt, you may want to look into iodine supplements, just to be safe. You can also consider using both kosher and table salts in your cooking.

## MSG

- TL;DR MSG is naturally occurring in many foods, including tomatoes and cheeses. It isn't a scary artificial chemical.
- However, some people really do have reactions and/or sensitivity to MSG, especially in larger amounts and on empty stomachs.

## Mayonnaise

- Use it on sandwich bread (by itself or as part of a spread) to act as a moisture barrier between the bread and ingredients, as well as adding some fat/lubrication.
- Use it like butter to brown the outsides of seared/roasted meat, roasted potatoes, grilled cheeses, etc.

## Storage Life - Refrigerator 

- Butter (unsalted): ~1-3 months
- White mushrooms: ~7 days (will get slimey when going bad)
- Broccoli: ~3-5 days
- Beef/red meat, pork/bacon: ~3-5 days (uncooked); ~3-5 days (cooked)
- Chicken/poultry, fish/seafood, ground meat: ~1-2 days (uncooked); ~3-5 days (cooked)
- Processed meat (hot dogs, cold cuts, etc): ~2 weeks (unopened); ~3-4 days (opened)
- Tofu: ~1 month (unopened); ~3-4 days (opened)

## Storage Life - Pantry

- **Note:** Things like bananas, apples, and onions should be stored away from other produce due to production of ethylene which hastens ripening.
- Garlic: 3-6 months (stored whole in a cool and dry place (NOT refrigerated, botulism risk))
- Onions: 1-2 months (stored whole in a cool and dry place (NOT refrigerated))
- Potatoes: 1-2 months (stored whole in a cool and dry place (NOT refrigerated))

## Extending Storage Life and Managing Expiration Dates

- Be mindful of produce that releases a lot of ethylene, which when stored together or with other produce will cause them to ripen and subsequently go bad more quickly.
- Consider using produce saver bags or containers that help manage air flow and/or moisture.
- Consider freezing things that keep and defrost well, especially for applications where preserving texture is not critical.
- Use removable sticker labels on bags and containers to clearly mark expiration dates, to make it easier to stay aware of upcoming or past dates.

## Reheating Refrigerated Leftover Pizza

- Heat the cold pizza slice in a non-stick skillet on medium heat for a few minutes until the bottom is warm and crispy.
- Add a couple of drops of water into the pan away from the pizza, cover the pan with a lid, and steam until the cheese is soft.

## Storage Life - Freezer

- Beef/red meat, pork/bacon: Best by ~4-12 months (pieces wrapped in freezer paper)
- Chicken/poultry, most fish: Best by ~4-12 months (pieces wrapped in freezer paper)
- Processed meat (hot dogs, cold cuts, etc): Best by ~1-2 months
- Ground meat, shellfish, fatty fish (ex. salmon): ~3 months
- Garlic: ~10-12 months (minced and frozen in freezer bag)
- Bread: ~3-6 months (slices separated by freezer paper; can wrap bread in plastic wrap for additional longevity)
- Tofu: ~3-6 months (drained and dried slices separated by freezer paper; frozen tofu will turn slightly yellower, and become firmer and chewier)
- Butter (unsalted): ~6 months

## General Freezing and Defrosting Tips

- Try to freeze items as thinly/flatly as possible, such as by spreading them out flat and freezing on a baking sheet before transferring to a freezer bag. This makes defrosting faster and more consistent due to the increased surface area, and for some foods, freezing individual pieces flat before throwing them together into a bag helps to keep them from clumping and freezing together.

## Freezing Meats

- Meat that isn't going to be used within the week should be frozen as soon as possible.
- Generally, try to keep meat as "whole" as possible when freezing, to minimize the effect on flavor and texture. However, you should also consider how much meat you will want to use after thawing. This means cutting the meat to size, based on how much will be needed for cooking (typically ~0.5-1 pound's worth) before freezing each cut separately. For safety (and texture) reasons, **never refreeze meat that has already been thawed once.**
- After cutting the meat, wrap each piece in freezer paper, optionally wrap again in aluminium foil, then put in a freezer bag (remove as much air as you can from the bag before sealing).
- To defrost meat, ideally let it slowly thaw in the refrigerator, typically ~24 hours before using, depending on the meat and size of the cut. If in a hurry, put the freezer bag with the meat in it into a bowl, put the bowl in the sink, then continually run cool or lukewarm water over the meat for a few hours, or as long as it takes to defrost.

## Freezing Vegetables

- Most green vegetables should be blanched, rinsed, and cooled before freezing. Blanching halts the enzymatic activity that would otherwise continue to decay the vegetables even after they are frozen.

## Freezing Garlic, Ginger, and Herbs

- Freezing garlic, ginger, and herbs preserves much of their flavor for a long time, and is useful in dishes where their texture is not important.
- Wash and slice, chop, or mince the items to be frozen, then pack into a freezer bag.
- For delicate herbs, you may want to cover with a neutral cooking oil. Garlic and ginger can be left as is.
- Carefully squeeze the air out of the bag before sealing it shut.
- Press the bag flat and freeze until the herbs are needed.

## Freezing and Reheating Bread

- To freeze bread for long-term storage (up to ~6 months), wrap each slice in plastic wrap, then wrap again with aluminium foil or freezer paper.
- Toss the wrapped bread into the freezer as is, or put into a freezer bag.
- To reheat frozen bread, bake slices in an oven or toaster oven at 350 degrees until heated through and slightly crispy (about 5-10 minutes).

## Freezing and Reheating Rice

- To freeze rice (for up to 1 month or so), flatten and wrap each serving in freezer paper or plastic wrap while still warm, then put into a freezer bag.
- Let the rice cool to room temperature, then put the bag into the freezer.
- To reheat the frozen rice, unwrap, put into a microwave-safe container, cover with a damp paper towel, and reheat for 1.5-2 minutes or until fully heated through.

## Freezing Tofu

- To freeze tofu, first remove it from the packaging and drain.
- Next, layer the tofu on top of paper towels or a flour sack towel, on a plate or cutting board. Cover the tofu with the towels, put another plate/board on top, and weigh down (more plates, bowl of water, etc.)
- Let the tofu press and drain for 15-20 minutes.
- Optionally, slice the tofu into pieces, and lay flat on a baking sheet, then freeze.
- Put the block or frozen slices of tofu into a freezer bag and freeze.
- Frozen tofu will lose its silky white appearance and texture and become yellower/browner, have a chewier texture, and more easily soak up sauces.

## Freezing Butter

- Keep the butter in its original packaging, covering any open sides with foil or plastic wrap.
- Put the butter inside of a freezer bag to keep it from absorbing the odors of other foods.
- Slice the butter normally and defrost, or grate it to help it defrost faster.
