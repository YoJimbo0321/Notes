# Ideal Wok Uses

- Stir frying
- Steaming (with steam rack/plate or steamer) (note: steaming may damage the seasoning)
- Deep frying (with tempura draining rack)
- Pseudo-parboiling/blanching (stir-frying and steaming vegetables with a bit of water)

# General Wok Use and Care

- Before cooking, lightly rinse the wok with water, as with any other cookware.
- Wipe the wok dry, and preheat it on the stovetop before cooking.
- After cooking, wash the wok out in the sink.
- Typically, all you will need is water and a scouring pad or wok brush.
- You can use some dish soap if there is heavy oil residue on the wok.
- Wipe the wok reasonably dry with a dish cloth or paper towel, then heat on the stove at medium-high heat until all moisture is completely gone.
- Longyau the wok with a bit of vegetable oil, and use a paper towel to lightly coat the whole inner surface.
- If the wooden handles on wok utensils become loose or rattle-y, pound them back into the metal portion with a mallet.

# Cleaning Burned Residue From a Wok

- [Optional] Depending on the severity of the mess, you might want to add a few spoonfuls of baking soda to the wok.
- Partially fill the wok with enough water to cover the bottom, and bring to a boil on high heat.
- Turn off the heat, and scrape off the softened residue with a wok spatula.
- Dump the scraped off residue and water in the sink, and repeat if necessary with more boiling water.
- Once the majority of the residue has been removed, the wok can be cleaned as usual in the sink.

# Seasoning a Wok

- NOTE: The first few times you use a wok after seasoning, it is normal for parts of the seasoning to chip or wear away unevenly. Continue to use the wok, re-seasoning by following the methods below when necessary, and the coating will even out and become stronger over time.
- NOTE: The oven method also works very well for seasoning aluminium baking sheets!

## Preparing a New Wok For Seasoning

- Preheat the oven to 500F.
- In a sink, THOROUGHLY scour the inside and outside of the wok with a scrubber and Bar Keepers Friend, to remove as much of the manufacturer's pre-coated oil as possible.
- Wipe the wok reasonably dry with a dish cloth, then heat on the stove top at medium-high heat until all moisture is completely gone.
- Place the wok upside down on an oven rack, then "bake" the wok for 60 minutes to further strip any of the remaining pre-coating.
- Let the wok cool down naturally.

## Seasoning - Oven Method

- Choose a neutral cooking oil with a relatively high smoke point (canola oil recommended).
- If using canola oil, preheat the oven to ~375F. For other oils, the oven temperature should be lower than but reasonably close to the oil's smoke point (as low as ~25F below). This is to make the polymerization process go faster without excessively denaturing the oil.
- If the wok has any wooden handles, remove any that can be removed. Cover the rest with wet rags or paper towels, then cover those with aluminium foil.
- Using a paper towel or microfiber cloth, soak lightly in canola oil (or other high smoke point oil), and thoroughly and evenly coat the entire surface of the wok, inside and out.
- **IMPORTANT** Make sure that the oil coating on the wok is VERY THIN. There should not be any visible dripping, beading, or pooling oil. The surface should look and feel almost dry.
- (Optional) Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and place it on the bottom rack of the oven to catch any stray drippings.
- Place the wok upside down on a middle rack (to prevent oil pooling) and bake it for 30-60 minutes.
- Flip the wok over, then bake again for another 30-60 minutes.
- Remove the wok from the oven and let cool. You can optionally speed up the cooling by SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY pouring warm water into the wok, dumping it into the sink, and repeating.
- Lightly wash the wok with warm water and soap. You can scrub away any heavy oil residue, but spots that are lightly tacky to the touch are okay to leave untouched, as they will continue to polymerize with use.
- Wipe the wok dry with a cloth and heat on the stove top at medium-high heat until all moisture is completely gone.
- Repeat the oiling, baking, and washing process a total of 2 or 3 times, making sure to moisten the rags protecting the handles each time, and making sure that every new layer of oil is just as thin.
- Once the wok has cooled down again, pour a few drops of vegetable oil into the wok and use a paper towel to lightly coat the whole inner surface.

## Seasoning - Ginger and Scallion Stir-fry Method

- Wash, dry, and chop 1 bunch of scallions into 2 inch pieces.
- Chop about 1/2 cup of ginger into fairly thin discs (no need to peel it).
- Preheat the wok on the stove top.
- Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil, and swirl it around the wok.
- Add the scallions and ginger, then reduce the heat to medium.
- Stir-fry for 15-20 minutes, using the spatula to press the mixture against the entire interior surface from top to bottom.
- If it gets too dry, add another tablespoon or two of oil.
- Let the wok cool, discard the mixture, then gently wash the wok with hot water and no soap.
- Wipe the wok dry with a cloth and heat on the stove top at medium-high heat until all moisture is completely gone.
- Once the wok has cooled down again, pour a few drops of vegetable oil into the wok and use a paper towel to lightly coat the whole inner surface.
