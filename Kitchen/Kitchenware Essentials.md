## Pros and Cons

### Carbon Steel Skillet

```plaintext
+ Best for sauteing.
+ Thin and heats up fast.
+ Relatively light weight and sloped sides make it good for tossing food.
+ Once seasoned, carbon steel provides a good enough non-stick surface for many uses (ex. frying eggs).

- Carbon steel requires seasoning and maintenance to develop a non-stick surface and prevent rust.
- Carbon steel is reactive, so it is not ideal for holding acidic ingredients (ex. tomato sauce, wine, sauces that contain lemon juice/vinegar, etc.) for an extended time, as they can leach a metallic taste.
```

### Carbon Steel Wok w/ Lid, 14"

```plaintext
+ Best for stir-frying and deep-frying due to the size and deep sloped sides.
+ Good for steaming (with racks or baskets).
+ Good for blanching/parboiling.
+ Thin and heats up fast.
+ Once seasoned, carbon steel provides a good enough non-stick surface for many uses (ex. frying eggs).

- Little to no flat surface makes it poorly suited to tasks like sauteing.
- Carbon steel requires seasoning and maintenance to develop a non-stick surface and prevent rust.
- Carbon steel is reactive, so it is not ideal for holding acidic ingredients (ex. tomato sauce, wine, sauces that contain lemon juice/vinegar, etc.) for an extended time, as they can leach a metallic taste.
```

### Cast Iron Skillet

```plaintext
+ Best for searing (ex. steaks).
+ High heat retention.
+ Once seasoned, cast iron provides a good enough non-stick surface for many uses (ex. frying eggs).

- Slow to heat up.
- Cast iron requires seasoning and maintenance to develop a non-stick surface and prevent rust.
- Cast iron is reactive, so it is not ideal for holding acidic ingredients (ex. tomato sauce, wine, sauces that contain lemon juice/vinegar, etc.) for an extended time, as they can leach a metallic taste.
```

### Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven, 6 Quart

```plaintext
+ Best for braising, soups, stews, etc.
+ High heat retention.
+ Enameled coating makes it safe to use for most ingredients.

- Slow to heat up.
- Requires careful use and handwashing to preserve the enameled coating.
```

### Nonstick Skillet w/Lid, 10"

```plaintext
+ Best non-stick surface for cooking eggs and other delicate foods.
+ Sloped sides make it good for tossing food.
+ Easy to clean due to the non-stick surface.

- Relatively poor choice for browning.
- Requires careful use and handwashing to preserve the non-stick coating.
- Even if used with care, the coating will still inevitably wear away over time and the pan will have to be replaced.
```

### Stock Pot

```plaintext
+ It's big.
+ Best for big batches and jobs (ex. making stock).
+ Stainless steel is non-reactive, so it is safe to use for most ingredients.

- It's big.
```

### Tri-Ply Stainless Steel Sauce Pan or Saucier w/ Lid, 3 Quart

```plaintext
+ It's small.
+ Best for small batches of soups or sauces.
+ Relatively quick to heat.
+ Stainless steel is non-reactive, so it is safe to use for most ingredients.

- It's small.
```

### Tri-Ply Stainless Steel Saute Pan w/ Lid, 5 Quart

```plaintext
+ Best for intentionally forming fonds and making pan sauces.
+ Good for shallow wet cooking (ex. sauces, pasta, braising, etc.).
+ Good for sauteing.
+ Stainless steel is non-reactive, so it is safe to use for most ingredients.

- High flat sides make it poorly suited to tossing food while sauteing.
- Stainless steel is not very non-stick, making it relatively poorly suited to tasks like frying eggs.
- Stainless steel can be annoying to clean due to the stuck food bits (often needs Barkeepers Friend and a scrubbing).
