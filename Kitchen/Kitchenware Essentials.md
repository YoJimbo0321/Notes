# Stovetop Cookware, ETC

## Essentials

- Dutch oven: Enameled cast iron; 6 quarts
- Sauce pan or saucier: Tri-ply stainless steel; 3+ quarts
- Saute pan: Tri-ply stainless steel; 5 quarts (12")
- Skillet: Carbon Steel; 10"
- Wok: Carbon steel; 14"

### Pros and Cons

```plaintext
Dutch oven: Enameled cast iron; 6 quarts

+ Best for braising, soups, stews, etc.
+ High heat retention.
+ Enameled coating makes it safe to use for most ingredients.

- Slow to heat up.
- Requires careful use and handwashing to preserve the enameled coating.
```

```plaintext
Sauce pan or saucier: Tri-ply stainless steel; 3+ quarts

+ It's small.
+ Best for small batches of soups, sauces, boiled eggs, etc.
+ Relatively quick to heat.
+ Stainless steel is non-reactive, so it is safe to use for most ingredients.
+ Stainless steel is uncoated and safe for use with metal utensils.

- It's small.
```

```plaintext
Saute pan: Tri-ply stainless steel; 5 quarts (12")

+ Best for intentionally forming fonds and deglazing to make pan sauces.
+ Good for shallow wet cooking (ex. sauces, pasta, braising, etc.).
+ Good for sauteing in larger batches.
+ Stainless steel is non-reactive, so it is safe to use for most ingredients.
+ Stainless steel is uncoated and safe for use with metal utensils.

- High flat sides make it poorly suited to tossing food while sauteing.
- Large diameter can lead to uneven heating on typical burners.
- Stainless steel is not very non-stick, making it relatively poorly suited to tasks like frying eggs.
- Stainless steel can be annoying to clean unless deglazed, due to the stuck food bits (often needs Barkeepers Friend and a scrubbing).
```

```plaintext
Skillet: Carbon Steel; 10"

+ Best for sauteing.
+ Good for searing.
+ Thin and heats up quickly.
+ Heats up relatively evenly on typical burners due to the small diameter.
+ Relatively light weight and sloped sides make it good for flipping/tossing food and stir-frying.
+ Once seasoned, carbon steel provides a good enough non-stick surface for many uses (ex. frying eggs).

- Small diameter may not be ideal for larger batches.
- Carbon steel requires seasoning and maintenance to develop a non-stick surface and prevent rust.
- Carbon steel is reactive, so it is not ideal for holding acidic ingredients (ex. tomato sauce, wine, sauces that contain lemon juice/vinegar, etc.) for an extended time, as they can leach a metallic taste.
```

```plaintext
Wok: Carbon steel; 14"

+ Best for flipping/tossing food, stir-frying, and deep-frying due to the size and deep, sloped sides.
+ Good for steaming (with racks or baskets).
+ Good for blanching/parboiling.
+ Thin and heats up quickly.
+ Once seasoned, carbon steel provides a good enough non-stick surface for many uses (ex. frying eggs).

- Little to no flat surface makes it relatively poorly suited to tasks like sauteing.
- Carbon steel requires seasoning and maintenance to develop a non-stick surface and prevent rust.
- Carbon steel is reactive, so it is not ideal for holding acidic ingredients (ex. tomato sauce, wine, sauces that contain lemon juice/vinegar, etc.) for an extended time, as they can leach a metallic taste.
```

## Optional Extras

- Skillet: Cast iron; 10"
- Skillet: Nonstick; 10"
- Stock pot: Tri-ply stainless steel; 8+ quarts

### Pros and Cons

```plaintext
Skillet: Cast iron; 10"

+ Best for high-heat searing (ex. steaks).
+ High heat retention.
+ Once seasoned, cast iron provides a good enough non-stick surface for many uses (ex. frying eggs).

- Slow to heat up.
- Heavy and unwieldy.
- Cast iron requires seasoning and maintenance to develop a non-stick surface and prevent rust.
- Cast iron is reactive, so it is not ideal for holding acidic ingredients (ex. tomato sauce, wine, sauces that contain lemon juice/vinegar, etc.) for an extended time, as they can leach a metallic taste.
```

```plaintext
Skillet: Nonstick; 10"

+ Best non-stick surface for cooking eggs and other delicate foods.
+ Sloped sides make it good for tossing food.
+ Easiest to clean due to the coated non-stick surface.

- Not oven-safe.
- Relatively poor choice for searing and browning.
- Requires careful use and handwashing to preserve the non-stick coating.
- Even if used with care, the coating will still inevitably wear away over time and the pan will have to be replaced.
```

```plaintext
Stock pot: Tri-ply stainless steel; 8+ quarts

+ It's big.
+ Best for particularly big batches and jobs (ex. making stock).
+ Stainless steel is non-reactive, so it is safe to use for most ingredients.
+ Stainless steel is uncoated and safe for use with metal utensils.

- It's big.
