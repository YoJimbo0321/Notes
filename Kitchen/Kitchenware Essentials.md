# Stovetop Cookware

## Essentials

- Dutch oven: Enameled cast iron; 6 quarts
- Sauce pan or saucier: Tri-ply stainless steel; 3 quarts
- Saute pan: Tri-ply stainless steel; 3+ quarts
- Skillet: Carbon steel; 12"
- Wok: Carbon steel; 14"

### Pros and Cons

```plaintext
Dutch oven: Enameled cast iron; 6 quarts

+ Best for braising, soups, stews, etc.
+ High heat retention.
+ Enameled coating makes it safe to use for most ingredients.

- Slow to heat up.
- Requires relatively careful use and handwashing to preserve the enameled coating.
```

```plaintext
Sauce pan or saucier: Tri-ply stainless steel; 3+ quarts

+ It's small.
+ Best for small batches of soups, sauces, boiled eggs, etc.
+ Relatively quick to heat.
+ Stainless steel is non-reactive, so it is safe to use for most ingredients.
+ Stainless steel is uncoated and safe for use with metal utensils.

- It's small.
```

```plaintext
Saute pan: Tri-ply stainless steel; ~3-5 quarts

+ Best for intentionally forming fonds to deglazing and make pan sauces with.
+ Good for sauteing and shallow wet cooking (ex. sauces, pasta, braising, etc.).
+ Stainless steel is non-reactive, so it is safe to use for most ingredients.
+ Stainless steel is uncoated and safe for use with metal utensils.

- High flat sides make it poorly suited to tossing food while sauteing.
- Larger diameter can lead to uneven heating on smaller burners.
- Stainless steel is not very non-stick, making it relatively poorly suited to tasks like frying eggs.
- Stainless steel can be annoying to clean unless deglazed, due to the stuck food bits (often needs Barkeepers Friend and a scrubbing).
```

```plaintext
Skillet: Carbon steel; 12"

+ Best for sauteing.
+ Good for high-heat searing.
+ Thin and heats up quickly.
+ Heats up relatively evenly on typical burners due to the small diameter.
+ Relatively light weight and sloped sides make it good for flipping/tossing food and stir-frying.
+ Once seasoned, carbon steel provides a good enough non-stick surface for many uses (ex. frying eggs).

- Larger diameter can lead to uneven heating on smaller burners.
- CI and CS require seasoning and maintenance to develop a non-stick surface and prevent rust.
- Even if well-seasoned, CI and CS will never become as non-stick as "true" non-stick surfaces, so they are not well-suited to particularly delicate dishes.
- CI and CS are reactive, so they are not ideal for holding acidic ingredients for an extended period (ex. tomato sauce, wine, lemon juice, vinegar, etc.). The acidic ingredients can damage the seasoning and leach a metallic taste into the food if left in too long (ex. reducing/braising for hours) and/or if the seasoning is not good enough. However, shorter cook times with adequate seasoning (and re-seasoning afterwards) should not present any significant issues.
```

```plaintext
Wok: Carbon steel; 14"

+ Best for flipping/tossing food, stir-frying, and deep-frying due to the size and deep, sloped sides.
+ Good for steaming (with racks or baskets).
+ Good for blanching/parboiling.
+ Thin and heats up quickly.
+ Once seasoned, carbon steel provides a good enough non-stick surface for many uses (ex. frying eggs).

- Little to no flat surface makes it relatively poorly suited to tasks like sauteing.
- CI and CS require seasoning and maintenance to develop a non-stick surface and prevent rust.
- Even if well-seasoned, CI and CS will never become as non-stick as "true" non-stick surfaces, so they are not well-suited to particularly delicate dishes.
- CI and CS are reactive, so they are not ideal for holding acidic ingredients for an extended period (ex. tomato sauce, wine, lemon juice, vinegar, etc.). The acidic ingredients can damage the seasoning and leach a metallic taste into the food if left in too long (ex. reducing/braising for hours) and/or if the seasoning is not good enough. However, shorter cook times with adequate seasoning (and re-seasoning afterwards) should not present any significant issues.
```

## Optional Extras

- Skillet: Cast iron; 10"
- Skillet: Nonstick; 10"
- Stock pot: Tri-ply stainless steel; 8+ quarts

### Pros and Cons

```plaintext
Skillet: Cast iron; 10"

+ Best for high-heat searing (ex. steaks).
+ High heat retention.
+ Once seasoned, cast iron provides a good enough non-stick surface for many uses (ex. frying eggs).

- Heats up slowly and unevenly, requiring a lengthy pre-heat before use.
- Heavy and unwieldy.
- CI and CS require seasoning and maintenance to develop a non-stick surface and prevent rust.
- Even if well-seasoned, CI and CS will never become as non-stick as "true" non-stick surfaces, so they are not well-suited to particularly delicate dishes.
- CI and CS are reactive, so they are not ideal for holding acidic ingredients for an extended period (ex. tomato sauce, wine, lemon juice, vinegar, etc.). The acidic ingredients can damage the seasoning and leach a metallic taste into the food if left in too long (ex. reducing/braising for hours) and/or if the seasoning is not good enough. However, shorter cook times with adequate seasoning (and re-seasoning afterwards) should not present any significant issues.
```

```plaintext
Skillet: Nonstick; 10"

+ Best non-stick surface for cooking eggs and other delicate foods.
+ Sloped sides and non-stick surface make it good for tossing food.
+ Smaller diameter helps it heat up faster and more evenly.
+ Easiest to clean due to the coated non-stick surface.

- Not oven-safe.
- Relatively poor choice for searing and browning.
- Requires relatively careful use and handwashing to preserve the enameled coating.
- Even if used with care, the coating will still inevitably wear away over time and the pan will have to be replaced.
```

```plaintext
Stock pot: Tri-ply stainless steel; 8+ quarts

+ It's big.
+ Best for particularly big batches and jobs (ex. making stock).
+ Stainless steel is non-reactive, so it is safe to use for most ingredients.
+ Stainless steel is uncoated and safe for use with metal utensils.

- It's big.
